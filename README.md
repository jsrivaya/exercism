## Exercism Solutions

Here you can find some solutions for the differn [Excercism](https://exercism.org/) tracks. Exercism practice problems have, as any coding problem, infinite solutions. Some better than othrs.
These are mine. This is just intended to share with anybody interseted in discovering a different way of solving a problem, some might be better than yours and others  might be worst.
Feel free to comment and suggest changes.

In general if there are multiple solutions for a problem, the higher iteration should have the better solution.
